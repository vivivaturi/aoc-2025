# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2025. All days are implemented in Rust.

## Structure

- `dayXX/`: Directory for each day's solution
  - Language-specific project files (e.g., Cargo.toml for Rust, package.json for Node.js)
  - `input.txt`: Puzzle input for the day
  - Source code files

## Running Solutions

Use the `run.sh` script to execute a specific day's solution:

```bash
./run.sh day01
```

Or run directly from the day's directory:

```bash
cd day01 && cargo run
```

## Days

- Day 1: Rust
